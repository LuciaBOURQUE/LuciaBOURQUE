# Hi there, I'm Lucia 👋🏽

## A passionate creativity frontend developer
Hello and thanks for dropping by my GitHub profile!

I'm Lucia, a UX/UI designer and freelance graphic artist with over four years of experience. My passion lies at the intersection of design and development, allowing me to switch gears and take on diverse projects. I predominantly work with Figma and Adobe Creative Cloud for UX/UI creation and graphic design.

Beyond my design journey, I'm a React frontend developer. I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of my skills, staying on top of the latest trends to refine my craft. Feel free to delve into my projects to get a glimpse of my creative world.

Currently, I'm diving into backend intricacies with Java and simultaneously crafting my soon-to-be-released website/portfolio. All the while, I'm diving into the exciting realm of NextJS.
Thanks again for visiting. Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
